# node-schematron

This is an Schematron minimal syntax implementation for front- and back-end Javascript. It can be used as
a NodeJS dependency as well as in the browser (ie. wrapped by Webpack). It returns a JSON object with the (resolved)
messages of your assertions.

## To use programmatically

To use programmatically, install to your project like any other npm module: `npm install node-schematron`

```js
const { Schema } = require('node-schematron');

const schema = Schema.fromString(`<schema xmlns="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron">
	<pattern>
		<rule context="thunder">
			<let name="lightning"/>
			<report test="$lightning/@foo = 'bar'">
				Skeet boop <value-of select="$lightning/@foo" />
			</report>
		</rule>
	</pattern>
</schema>`);

const results = schema.validateString(`<xml foo="err">
	<thunder foo="bar" />
</xml>`, { debug: true });

// results === [
//   {
//      isReport: true,
//      context: <thunder foo="bar" />,
//      message: '\n\t\t\t\tSkeet boop bar\n\t\t\t'
//   }
// ]
```

## To use from command line

To use as a command in your terminal, install globally like: `npm install -g node-schematron`. Alternatively, you can
use `npx` to run it.



The `node-schematron` command has two parameters, the last one of which is optional:

1. `schematronLocation`, required, an absolute path or relative reference to your schematron XML. For example `my-schema.sch`.
2. `globPattern`, optional, a globbing pattern for documents. For example `*.{xml,dita}` (all .xml and .dita files). Defaults to `*.xml` (all .xml files).

```sh
/Users/Wybe/Docs/schematron-test:
  node-schematron my-schema.sch
  # Gives the results for all "*.xml" files in this directory
```

```sh
/Users/Wybe/Docs/schematron-test:
  node-schematron my-schema "docs/**/*.xml"
  # Gives the results for all "*.xml" files in the docs/ directory and all subdirectories
```

Besides that you can give it a fair amount of options:

| Long name     | Short | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| `--reporters` | `-r`  | The reporter(s) to use. Zero or many of `npm` or `xunit`, space separated. |
| `--ok`        | `-o`  | Do not exit process with an error code if at least one document fails a schematron assertion. |
| `--debug`     | `-D`  | Display extra stack trace information in case of XPath errors |
| `--files`     | `-f`  | A list of files, in case you can't use the globbing parameter. |
| `--batch`     | `-b`  | The number of documents to handle before opening the next child process. Defaults to `5000`. |
| `--phase`     | `-p`  | The schematron phase to run. Defaults to `#DEFAULT` (which means the `@defaultPhase` value or `#ALL`. |
| `--log-level` | `-l`  | The amount of stuff to log. Only used if `-r` includes `npm`. Value must be one of `silly`, `info`, `report`, `pass`, `assert`, `fail`, `fileError` or `error`. Defaults to `info`. |

```sh
/Users/Wybe/Docs/schematron-test:
  node-schematron my-schema.sch "**/*.xml" --phase publication --log-level fail
  # Validates the "publication" phase and logs only the paths of documents that fail
```

```sh
/Users/Wybe/Docs/schematron-test:
  node-schematron my-schema.sch "**/*.xml" -r xunit > test-reports/test-report.xml
  # Validates the "publication" phase and writes an XUnit XML report to file
```

## Custom functions

To define custom XPath functions, import `registerCustomXPathFunction`:

```js
const { registerCustomXPathFunction } = require('node-schematron');

registerCustomXPathFunction(
  {
    localName: 'is-foo',
    namespaceURI: 'http://example.com',
  },
  ['xs:string?'],
  'xs:boolean',
  (domFacade, input) => input === 'foo'
);
```

The `registerCustomXPathFunction` is an alias for the same function in `fontoxpath`. See the
[fontoxpath "global functions" documentation](https://github.com/FontoXML/fontoxpath#global-functions) for more
information.


## Compliance

As for features, check out the unit tests in `test/`. I've mirrored them to the text of [ISO/IEC 19757-3 2016](./docs/c055982_ISO_IEC_19757-3_2016.pdf) in order to clearly assert how far `node-schematron` is up to spec.
I've also noticed there's different ways you can read that text, so please file an issue if you feel `node-schematron`
behaves in a non-standard or buggy way.

## Support

-   Every pull request will be considered and responded to.
-   The schematron query language is XPath 3.1, implemented by [fontoxpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fontoxpath). It
    is [not yet feature complete](https://documentation.fontoxml.com/editor/latest/xpath-25591894.html).
